## subtitler.sh
Convenience script to extract subtitles from a media file, translate them to the target language, and embed both the original and the target subtitles back into the original media.

Uses [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org) for media handling; [Whisper](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) for speech recognition; and [translatesubs](https://github.com/Montvydas/translatesubs) for translation using Google Translate.
